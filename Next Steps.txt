some todo:
- change hop add alerts to a modal (hope to push notifications some day)
- finish formatting the alert message
- make the list of steps clickable to jump to that step and set the timer
- add functionality to add time to a timer without setting a new one.

- add ability to clear all of the data (including the recipe selected)
  - basically dump everything from localStorage.

beer xml gets:
  *** there are many cool things in the <NOTES> element of a beer msl file ***
  - ABV *
  - est OG *
  - batch size *

  - pre boil grav
  - pre boil vol
  - (not from beer xml) acid amts, strike pH, mash pH, boil pH

  - first wort hops
  - dry hops

  - est FG
  - strike temp (infuse temp of the fist step)
  (separate page for these?)
  - grains/amounts/percentages
  - yeast
  - notes?

- add functionality to "upload" files to the recipes directory

- clean up app.py (doc strings!?!)

  timer step concerns:

  - what happens when we set a manual timer after a recipe has been selected?
  - it currently keeps the step label in place, perhaps it should change the label
  to "Manual" or some such. This would require a new function to set the label
  and then call setTimer().
  - We should also have the ability to go back to the main brew timers
  once that is done.
